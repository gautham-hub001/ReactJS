### state vs props

props is if you want to pass some info like text (title, description). And each time the same component will have different title and desceription, so props is used.
state is if you are having like a counter and you update it based on previous count(state), so we use state there.

Note: React was created by Facebook

npx create-react-app name-of-app

It will add all the biolderplate code, so you can delete all files in public folder except for index.html. We can also remove all the files in src folder except for App.js and index.js. Remove all the imports too and return null in App.js.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
